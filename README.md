Fake News Classification using Machine Learning

This project is focused on detecting fake news using machine learning techniques. It analyzes news article content to determine whether it is real or fake, aiming to combat the spread of misinformation.

Objective

The goal is to build a classification model capable of identifying fake news articles through text analysis and supervised learning.

Project Files

main.py: Core script containing preprocessing, training, and evaluation

requirements.txt: Python dependencies

README.md: Documentation for the project

Methodology

Data loading from a labeled dataset (real vs. fake news)

Text preprocessing: lowercasing, tokenization, stopword and punctuation removal

Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization

Model training using algorithms such as Logistic Regression or PassiveAggressiveClassifier

Evaluation through accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score

Installation

Install all dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Project

Run the classifier using:

python main.py

Make sure the dataset is present in the working directory and correctly referenced in the script.

Future Enhancements

Use deep learning models like LSTM or BERT

Create a web-based interface for public access

Improve accuracy with larger and more diverse datasets
